			(Later on) It is a relief to be out of the desert! 		
			Surely I will find a drop to drink, a bite to eat, 		
			or a soft place to rest in this village. 		
			It is a marvel how many beautiful objects 		
			I have seen in this market as I wander around it. 		
			
			<br/><br/>		
			
			Oh wow! Especially here! I am stunned by this beautiful piece of art! 		
			I have never seen anything like this! I want to buy it. 		
			Which of these was it that caught your eye?
